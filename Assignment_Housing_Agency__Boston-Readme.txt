For the 1st solution

Explanation:
sns.boxplot(x=boston_df['MEDV']): This creates a boxplot using Seaborn for the MEDV column.
plt.title('...') and plt.xlabel('...'): These lines add a title and label to the plot for better understanding.
plt.show(): Displays the plot.
When you run this code, it will show the boxplot for the median value of owner-occupied homes, allowing you to visualize the distribution and detect any potential outliers in the dataset.


For the 2nd solution
Explanation:
sns.histplot(boston_df['CHAS'], bins=2, kde=False): This creates a histogram with 2 bins, as the CHAS variable is a binary variable (0 or 1). The kde=False argument ensures that a kernel density estimate is not plotted, which is more appropriate for continuous data.
plt.title('...'), plt.xlabel('...'), and plt.ylabel('...'): These lines add a title and axis labels to make the plot more informative.
plt.show(): Displays the plot.
When you run this code, the histogram will show the distribution of properties that either bound the Charles River (CHAS = 1) or do not (CHAS = 0).



For the 3rd Solution
Explanation:
Discretization (pd.cut):
bins=[0, 35, 50, 100] specifies the intervals for the age groups.
labels=['35 years and younger', 'between 35 and 50 years', 'older than 50 years'] provides labels for the age groups.
Boxplot (sns.boxplot):
x='AGE_Group' specifies the discretized age groups on the x-axis.
y='MEDV' plots the median value of homes on the y-axis.
data=boston_df indicates the DataFrame used.
Running this code will produce a boxplot showing how the median value of homes (MEDV) varies across different age groups (AGE_Group).


For the 4th Solution
Explanation:
Scatter Plot (sns.scatterplot):
x='INDUS' sets the x-axis to the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
y='NOX' sets the y-axis to nitric oxide concentration.
data=boston_df specifies the DataFrame used for plotting.
Running this code will display a scatter plot showing the relationship between NOX and INDUS.

Interpretation of the Relationship:
From the scatter plot, you might observe a positive correlation between NOX (Nitric oxide concentration) and INDUS (proportion of non-retail business acres per town). This suggests that areas with a higher proportion of non-retail business acres tend to have higher nitric oxide concentrations, which could imply that industrial activities contribute to air pollution in those areas.


For the 5th Solution
Explanation:
Histogram (sns.histplot):
boston_df['PTRATIO']: Specifies the data for the histogram.
bins=10: Divides the data into 10 bins for the histogram.
kde=False: Ensures that only the histogram is plotted, without a kernel density estimate.
Running this code will generate a histogram showing the distribution of the pupil-to-teacher ratio across different towns. The histogram will help you understand how the pupil-to-teacher ratio is distributed within the dataset, identifying common values or potential outliers.


For the 6th Solution
Explanation:
Explanation:
scipy.stats.pearsonr(boston_df['NOX'], boston_df['INDUS']): This function returns the Pearson correlation coefficient and the p-value.
Correlation Coefficient (pearson_corr): Indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the variables.
P-value (p_value): Helps determine the statistical significance of the observed correlation. A low p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) suggests that the observed correlation is statistically significant.
Interpretation:
If the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1, it indicates a strong relationship between NOX and INDUS.
If the P-value is low (≤ 0.05), you can conclude that the relationship is statistically significant.
Conclusion:
If the Pearson correlation coefficient is significantly different from 0 (either positive or negative), and the p-value is low, it suggests that there is a relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
If the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 0 and the p-value is high, it suggests that there is no significant linear relationship between the two variables.
Run the code to see the exact values and make the conclusion based on the results.
